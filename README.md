==============

Starter project code for students taking Udacity ud120

We will use pip to install some packages. First get and install pip from here. Using pip, install a bunch of python packages:

go to your terminal line (don’t open python, just the command prompt)
install sklearn: pip install scikit-learn
-- for your reference, here’s the sklearn installation instructions
install natural language toolkit: pip install nltk
Get the Intro to Machine Learning source code. You will need git to clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/udacity/ud120-projects.git
You only have to do this once, the code base contains the starter code for all the mini-projects. Go into the tools/ directory, and run startup.py. It will first check for the python modules, then download and unzip a large dataset that we will use heavily later. The download/unzipping can take a while.
